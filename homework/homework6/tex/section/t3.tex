\textcolor{blue}{Problem 3}
Similar to problem $3$ in assignment $3$ and assignment $4$, you need to use the SUV dataset to implement (using Python or MATLAB) the $L_1$/$L_2$ regularization (penalty/augmented).
\begin{itemize}
    \item Present your code.
    \item Present the path plots of $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization. (Notice: you need to mark the selected value of the regular parameter)
    \item Analyze the weight difference between $L_1$ and $L_2$ regularization. (Notice: you need to describe the similarities and differences between the solutions of path plots)
    \item If you only want to build a model that contains $2$ variables, which two features would you choose?
\end{itemize}
