\textcolor{blue}{Problem 2}
[The Lasso algorithm] Rather than a soft order constraint on the squares of the weights, one could use the absolute values of the weights:
\begin{align*}
\min &\ E_{\text {in }}(\mathbf{w}) \\
\text { subject to } &\ \sum_{i=0}^d\left|w_i\right| \leq C
\end{align*}

The model is called the lasso algorithm.\\
(a) Formulate and implement this as a quadratic program.\\
(b) What is the augmented error and discuss the algorithm for solving it. You can solve this problem using iterative soft-thresholding algorithm or a gradient projection method and present your pseudocode.
