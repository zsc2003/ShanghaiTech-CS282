\textcolor{blue}{Problem 3}

Let $\mathcal{H}=\left\{h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_M\right\}$ with some finite $M$. Prove that $d_{\mathrm{vc}}(\mathcal{H}) \leq \log _2 M$.

\textcolor{blue}{Solution}\\
Since there are totally $M$ hypothesis in $\mathcal{H}$, so we can generate $M$ results with these $M$ hypothesis.\\
And since $d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal H)$ means that for $d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal H)$ groups of data, the hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$ can seperate all $2^{d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal H)}$ cases.\\
Since the maximum number of cases that can be seperated by the hypothesis $\mathcal{H}$ is $M$, so we have
$$2^{d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal H)}\leq M$$
i.e.
$$d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal H)\leq \log_2M$$

So above all, we have proved that $d_{\text{vc}}(\mathcal H)\leq \log_2M$.
