\textcolor{blue}{Problem 3}
According to the iterative format provided as follow:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the SUV dataset to implement (using Python or MATLAB) the Gradient Descent method to find the optimal model for logistic regression.
    \item What is your test error? What are the sizes of the training set and test set, respectively?
    \item What is your learning rate? How was it chosen? How many steps were iterated in total?
    \item Present the results of the last 10 steps produced by your algorithm, including the loss, learning rate, the L2 norm of the gradient, and the number of function evaluations and gradient evaluations.
\end{itemize}
