\textcolor{blue}{Problem 2}
For linear regression, the out-of-sample error is 
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{out}}(h)=\mathbb{E}[{(h(x)-y)}^2].
\end{equation}
Show that among all hypotheses, the one that minimizes $E_{\text{out}}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    h^*(x)=\mathbb{E}[y|x].
\end{equation}
The function $h^*$ can be treated as a deterministic target function, in which case we can write $y=h^*(x)+\epsilon(x)$ where $\epsilon(x)$ is an (input dependent) noise variable. Show that $\epsilon(x)$ has expected value zero.
